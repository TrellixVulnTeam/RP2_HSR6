        <div class="intro">
            <p id="abstract">Through the COVID-19 pandemic and the shift in modern technology, much of our communication platforms are online forums. As such, there is an expectation to be able to communicate via online platforms. For many neurodivergent individuals, methods of communication are different from their neurotypical peers. Krishnapriya Nair and the Comm-unity team aim to create a social media-style web application for middle school-aged children on the autism spectrum to practice their communication skills and create a sense of community among their peers. Typically, this process is done through Social Skills Training Programs (SSTP) creating a right and wrong way of communicating. Rather than introducing a standard of correctness for communication, the aim of this project is to provide an outlet for individuals on the spectrum to practice and improve their social skills in an environment we hope is most comfortable. </p>
